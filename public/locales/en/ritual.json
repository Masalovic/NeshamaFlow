  "guides": {
    "box-breath-2m": {
      "title": "What to do",
      "why": "Slow, equal-length inhales/holds/exhales target ~6 breaths/min, increasing vagal tone and shifting the autonomic balance toward parasympathetic “rest-and-digest”. Clinicians use it for acute stress to reduce amygdala reactivity and stabilize HRV.",
      "whyBullets": [
        "Activates parasympathetic (“rest & digest”)",
        "Stabilizes HRV under stress",
        "Simple 4-4-4-4 cadence"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Sit upright; relax shoulders and jaw.",
        "Inhale through the nose for a count of 4.",
        "Hold the breath for a count of 4.",
        "Exhale through the nose (or pursed lips) for a count of 4.",
        "Hold empty for a count of 4. Repeat the 4–4–4–4 “box” 4–8 cycles."
      ],
      "tip": "If 4 seconds feels long, try 3–3–3–3. Keep the breath smooth, never strained."
    },

    "478-pace-2m": {
      "title": "What to do",
      "why": "Lengthened exhale activates the vagus nerve and dampens sympathetic arousal. The 4-7-8 pattern briefly increases CO₂ tolerance and can reduce perceived anxiety and time-to-sleep in small trials.",
      "whyBullets": [
        "Long exhale → vagal activation",
        "Builds CO₂ tolerance",
        "Helpful for anxiety & sleep"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Sit comfortably; tip of tongue lightly behind upper teeth (optional).",
        "Inhale quietly through the nose for a count of 4.",
        "Hold the breath for a count of 7.",
        "Exhale softly through the mouth for a count of 8.",
        "Continue the 4–7–8 cycle at a smooth, unforced pace."
      ],
      "tip": "Use at bedtime: 3–4 rounds is plenty."
    },

    "body-scan-1m": {
      "title": "What to do",
      "why": "Rapid interoceptive check-in recruits somatosensory networks and shifts attention from ruminative loops. Brief body scans are associated with reduced perceived stress and improved emotion regulation.",
      "whyBullets": [
        "Interrupts rumination quickly",
        "Improves interoceptive awareness",
        "Works anywhere, no tools"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Get comfortable (sit or lie); soften gaze or close eyes.",
        "Bring attention to the feet; notice contact, temperature, tingling.",
        "Move slowly upward—calves, knees, thighs, hips, belly, chest, shoulders, arms, hands, neck, face, scalp.",
        "Label sensations (pressure, warmth, tight/loose, neutral) without judging or changing them.",
        "When the mind wanders, gently return to the last body area."
      ],
      "tip": "Short and frequent beats long and rare."
    },

    "ground-54321": {
      "title": "What to do",
      "why": "Orienting to the five senses engages prefrontal attention networks and down-regulates limbic threat appraisal. Widely used in CBT for panic and anger surges to interrupt catastrophizing.",
      "whyBullets": [
        "Sensory focus lowers threat response",
        "CBT-friendly, fast to learn",
        "Great for panic/anger spikes"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Look around: name 5 things you can see (silently or aloud).",
        "Notice 4 things you can feel (e.g., chair, clothing, air).",
        "Identify 3 things you can hear (near and far).",
        "Notice 2 things you can smell.",
        "Notice 1 thing you can taste (or take a sip of water)."
      ],
      "tip": "Speak the items quietly to anchor attention."
    },

    "compassion-break": {
      "title": "What to do",
      "why": "Brief self-kindness statements lower cortisol and reduce self-criticism. Framing difficulty as “common humanity” supports cognitive reappraisal and resilience.",
      "whyBullets": [
        "Reduces self-criticism",
        "Promotes cognitive reappraisal",
        "Short script you can memorize"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Acknowledge: “This is a moment of suffering / This is hard.”",
        "Common humanity: “I’m not alone; others feel this way too.”",
        "Kindness: place a hand on the heart (or other soothing touch).",
        "Offer phrases: “May I be kind to myself; may I accept myself as I am; may I be patient.”"
      ],
      "tip": "Use a warm tone as if speaking to a dear friend."
    },

    "gratitude-3": {
      "title": "What to do",
      "why": "Micro-gratitude exercises increase positive affect and broaden attentional scope. Repeated practice correlates with improved mood and sleep quality in multiple RCTs.",
      "whyBullets": [
        "Boosts positive affect",
        "Widens attentional scope",
        "Easy daily micro-practice"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Bring to mind one specific thing you appreciate (e.g., “sun on the kitchen table”).",
        "Name why it matters in one sentence.",
        "Repeat with two more specifics (total of three)."
      ],
      "tip": "Specific beats general. Picture it and notice how the body feels."

    },
    "boxBreath": {
      "1": "Take one slower breath and unclench your jaw.",

    },
    "478": {
      "1": "If light-headed, breathe normally for a minute.",
